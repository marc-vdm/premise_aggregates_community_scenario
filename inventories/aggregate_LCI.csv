comment,"Duplicated and edited from 'diesel, burned in building machine'.
Edited for HVO diesel based on: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623001476?via%3Dihub

At 0.0234 kg diesel, this activity would be equal to burning 0.03l diesel (780kg/m3, table 2 in source)

edits:
- replaced diesel with HVO diesel
- increased output (efficiency) by 4.36% 
- replaced CO2, CO and CH4 with biogenic ones
- lowered emissions based on paper: 
  - NOx 30%, 
  - HC 75%, 
  - CO 81%,
  - particulate matter (PM)  55.3%


Original description for 'diesel, burned in building machine':
This module is based on the data included in the report Oekoinventare von Energiesystemen 1996. The diesel consumption and the emissions are updated using the Swiss ""Offroad database"" and applied to year 2000. This moduleshould not be used if its relative importance would be high in a certain environmental inventory.
[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]
Geography:  Certain elementary flows or intermediate product flows are extrapolated from RER and CH conditions.
Technology:  Average current technology for one typical machine representing the category.",,,,,,,,,,,,
